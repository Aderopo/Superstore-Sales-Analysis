### Recommendations
---
1. Focus on high performing states: California, New York, and Texas have the highest sales figures. The company is advised to strengthen marketing and customer engagement strategies in these states to sustain and grow sales.
2. Improve sales in low-performing states: Target promotions, localized marketing campaigns, or adjusting product offerings would help increase sales in regions with low sales.
3. Optimize Product Category Strategy: Technology has the highest sales ($836,154) and profit ($145,455), making it the most profitable category. The company should continue investing in technology products. Furniture has high sales ($738,004) but significantly lower profit ($18,451). The company should assess pricing, cost structure, and discount strategies in this category to improve profitability.
